# test-user-creator
A Python utility script for automated bulk creation of test users and their profiles via API requests. Supports configurable options for user count, login-based JWT authentication, and optional profile creation. Ideal for quickly populating development or staging environments with realistic test data.

**Note:** This script is customized for a specific API setup — for example, it includes parameters like `w8_generation`. You can easily tinker with it or modify these parameters to match your own API’s requirements before running it.
